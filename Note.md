## GIT NOTE
git init is the first command and it's used to initialized the command.
The u by the top left side means untracked(git is not currently tracking the file).
The next command is git add .(this is to stage all the file (. means everything))
The u changes to A(means added- shows that all the files have been added to git tracking list).
The next command is git commit -m ""(used to safe your changes).
To put your user email and user name you enter the following on your terminal
(git config --global user.email "beckkyjayz@gmail.com")
(git config --global user.name "Beckkygitz") 
M on the top left means modified- that you made a change but github has not yet added or saved it. so for git to take note and save the changes, you go back to the last command.
git add .
git commit -m "make a change" and enter.
If you don't want git to take note of the changes you are making, you create a gitignore file. on your terminal now press a (.gitignore) and enter.
To create a new branch for your work, you need to enter this command (git branch 'name') this will switch the branch
